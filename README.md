# Windows Dockerfiles

This is a collection of Dockerfiles that can be used in Windows Server containers.

Each directory represents an individual configuration and should contain a `README` file with additional detail.

_Special thanks to Stefan Scherer for an awesome [collection of Windows Dockerfile examples](https://github.com/StefanScherer/dockerfiles-windows) as well as the Appveyor scaffolding used in this Repo._
